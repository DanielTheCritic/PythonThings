Naive Bayes
============
Determines how other factors collerate to the evaluation with equal weight.
This allows for better performance and a smaller data set.
E.G Blood Pressure, BMI, No. Pregnancies are given equal weight when collerating with Diabetes(true/false)
Simple
Fast - up to 100x faster
Stable to data changes

Logistic Regression
=============
Returns a binary result, weighing each relationship as either true or false.

Decision Tree
============
Binary tree of yes or no questions
Node contains decision.
Requires a lot of data to cater for permutations and splits.
E.G Is Male ? Yes  ===> Is Male Over 25 ? ===> Yes ...etc ...etc like a tree.
